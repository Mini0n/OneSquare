AC:

Using AngularJS, create an application which is able to search repositories on github,
it should render those repositories in a list which is going to be clickable, if the user
clicks an element of that list, it should display the comments showing the most recent ones
at the top

You should build this application using TDD, you can use the framework you like for this
step: Mocha, Jasmine, Tape, Jest, etc.

Use an CSS preprocesor (SASS/Stylus/LESS) to generate all the styles of the
application

OPTIONAL: Use an autoprefixer to give support to the most common browsers

OPTIONAL: Add a linter (ESLint) too, with at least these rules:

Errors:

- no-console
- no-debugger
- no-empty
- eqeqeq
- no-empty-pattern

Warnings:

- no-delete-var
- no-undef
- no-unreachable
- no-extra-semi
- no-dupe-keys

OPTIONAL: Create a build script which is going to prepare your code for production, this means
you need to generate an scriot which is going to compile your current code to regular JS/CSS/HTML

CHALLANGE: Using a Natural Language framework, determine if the comment is positive or
negative

CHALLANGE: create this application using Vue or React instead of Angular

CHALLANGE: Give support for IE 10

Once the application is completed, create a repository on your own github profile and upload
this application
